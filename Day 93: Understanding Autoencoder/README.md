## Day 93: Understanding Autoencoder

**Learning Agenda of Day 93 is :**

- Understanding Autoencoder: 
	- Learn about the concept of Autoencoder and their architecture, including the encoder and decoder networks.

- Types of Autoencoder: 
	- Learn about the different types of Autoencoder such as vanilla Autoencoder, Denoising Autoencoder, and Variational Autoencoder.

- Training Autoencoder: 
	- Learn about the process of training Autoencoder, including the different hyperparameters that can be adjusted and how to choose appropriate values for them.

- Applications of Autoencoder: 
	- Learn about the different tasks that Autoencoder can be used for such as dimensionality reduction, data denoising, and feature learning.

- Practice building and training Autoencoder for image generation tasks using popular datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.

- Introduction to Autoencoder variants such as Convolutional Autoencoder and Recurrent Autoencoder
