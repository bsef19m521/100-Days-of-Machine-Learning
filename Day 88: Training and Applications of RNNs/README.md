## Day 88: Training and Applications of RNNs

**Learning Agenda of Day 88 is :**

- Training an RNN: 
	- Training an RNN involves adjusting the weights and biases of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output. 
	- The process of training an RNN includes different hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, it's important to understand how to adjust these hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model.

- Applications of RNNs: 
	- RNNs have a wide range of applications in sequence data tasks. 
	- Learn about the different tasks that RNNs can be used for such as natural language processing, speech recognition, and time series forecasting. 
	- Understanding the different applications of RNNs will help you understand the potential of this type of model and how to apply them to different problems.
