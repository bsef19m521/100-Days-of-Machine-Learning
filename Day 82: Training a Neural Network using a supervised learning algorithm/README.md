## Day 82: Training a Neural Network using a Supervised Learning Algorithm 

**Learning Agenda of Day 82 is :**
- Understanding the basic components of a neural network: 
	- A neural network is made up of layers of interconnected nodes or artificial neurons. 
	- Each layer contains a set of weights and biases that are updated during training, and an activation function that determines the output of each neuron. -
	- Understanding how these components work together is important for building and training a neural network.

- Training a neural network using a supervised learning algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent: 
	- The process of training a neural network involves adjusting the weights and biases of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output. 
	- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm used to update the weights and biases during training.

- Evaluating the performance of a neural network using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall: 
	- Once the model is trained, it's important to evaluate its performance on new, unseen data. 
	- Common metrics used to evaluate the performance of a neural network include accuracy, precision, and recall. 
	- These metrics provide insight into how well the model is able to make predictions and identify patterns in the data.
