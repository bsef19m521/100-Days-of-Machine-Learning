# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning

## Day 83: Simple Feedforward Neural Network for Image and Text Classification

**Learning Agenda of Day 83 is :**

- Practice building simple feedforward neural networks for image classification tasks using popular datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR-10: 
	- These datasets are widely used in the machine learning community and are a great way to practice building and training neural networks for image classification tasks.

- Practice building simple feedforward neural networks for text classification tasks using popular datasets such as IMDB and 20 Newsgroups: 
	- These datasets are also widely used in the machine learning community and are a great way to practice building and training neural networks for text classification tasks.

- Introduction to Hyperparameter tuning: 
	- Hyperparameter tuning is the process of adjusting the configuration of a model in order to improve its performance.
