## Day 86: Building and Training CNNs for Image Classification

**Learning Agenda of Day 86 is :**

- Applications of CNNs: 
	- CNNs have a wide range of applications in image recognition and classification tasks. 
	- Learn about the different tasks that CNNs can be used for such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and facial recognition. 
	- Understanding the different applications of CNNs will help you understand the potential of this type of model and how to apply them to different problems.

- Practice building and training CNNs for image classification tasks using popular datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet: 
	- Practicing building and training CNNs for image classification tasks using popular datasets is important for gaining hands-on experience and understanding how to apply CNNs to real-world problems. It also provides a way to benchmark your progress and compare your results with other models.
