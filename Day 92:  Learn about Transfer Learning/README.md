# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning

## Day 92: Understanding of Transfer Learning

**Learning Agenda of Day 92 is :**

- Understanding Transfer Learning: 
	- Learn about the concept of transfer learning, and how pre-trained models can be used as a starting point to train models for new tasks.

- Using pre-trained models: 
	- Learn about the different types of pre-trained models available and how to use them for different tasks such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing.

- Fine-tuning pre-trained models: 
	- Learn about the process of fine-tuning pre-trained models for different tasks, including how to adjust the hyperparameters and how to choose appropriate values for them.

- Applications of Transfer Learning: 
	- Learn about the different tasks that transfer learning can be used for such as image classification, object detection, and natural language processing.

- Practice using pre-trained models for image classification tasks using popular datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
