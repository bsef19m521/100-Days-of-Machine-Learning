# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning

## Day 84: Understanding the architecture of CNNs and Pooling Layers

**Learning Agenda of Day 84 is :**
- Understanding the architecture of CNNs: 
	- This includes learning about the different types of layers that make up a CNN, such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. 
	- Understanding the purpose and function of each layer is important for building and training a CNN.

- Convolutional layers and filters: 
	- Convolutional layers are a key component of CNNs, they are responsible for detecting patterns and features in images. 
	- The filters in convolutional layers are used to detect specific features in the image, such as edges or textures. 
	- Understanding how convolutional layers and filters work is important for building and training a CNN.

- Pooling layers: 
	- Pooling layers are used to reduce the spatial size of the feature maps produced by convolutional layers. 
	- They are used to reduce the dimensionality of the data and make the network more robust to small translations and distortions. 
	- Understanding the role and function of pooling layers is important for building and training a CNN.
