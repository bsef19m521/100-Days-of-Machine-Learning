# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning

The prerequisites for starting a 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning are following:

- **Basic mathematical concepts:** Calculus, and Probability are fundamental concepts used in ML.

- **Programming skills:** Familiarity with programming language such as Python is required as it is commonly used in ML.

- **Basic knowledge of statistics:** An understanding of statistical concepts such as mean, median, standard deviation, and probability distributions is important.

- **Familiarity with data structures and algorithms:** Basic knowledge of data structures such as arrays, lists, and matrices, as well as algorithms such as sorting and searching, is helpful.

- **Basic knowledge of data analysis:** Understanding of data analysis concepts such as `data cleaning`, `preprocessing`, and `data visualization` will help in understanding the data and make the best use of it.
