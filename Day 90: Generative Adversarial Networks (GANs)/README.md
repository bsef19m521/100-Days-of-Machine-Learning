# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning

## Day 90: Understanding Generative models: Generative Adversarial Networks

**Learning Agenda of Day 90 is :**

- Understanding Generative models: Learn about the different types of generative models and their applications, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

- GANs architecture: 
	- Learn about the architecture of GANs, including the generator and discriminator networks, and how they are used to generate new data.

- Training GANs: 
	- Learn about the process of training GANs, including the different hyperparameters that can be adjusted and how to choose appropriate values for them.


- Applications of GANs : 
	- Learn about the different tasks that GANs can be used for such as image synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation.

- Practice building and training GANs  for image generation tasks using popular datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
