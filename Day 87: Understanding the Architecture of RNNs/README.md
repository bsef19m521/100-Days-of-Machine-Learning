# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning

## Day 87: Understanding the Architecture of RNNs

**Learning Agenda of Day 87 is :**

- Understanding the architecture of RNNs: 
	- This includes learning about the different types of layers that make up an RNN, such as the input layer, recurrent layer, and output layer. 
	- Understanding the purpose and function of each layer is important for building and training an RNN.

- Recurrent layers and memory cells: 
	- Recurrent layers are a key component of RNNs, they are responsible for processing sequential data. 
	- Memory cells in recurrent layers are used to store information from previous time steps and use it to inform the current time step. 
	- Understanding how recurrent layers and memory cells work is important for building and training an RNN.
