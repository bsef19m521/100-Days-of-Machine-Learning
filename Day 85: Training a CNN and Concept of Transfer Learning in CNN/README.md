## Day 85: Training a CNN and Concept of Transfer Learning in CNN

**Learning Agenda of Day 85 is :**
- Fully connected layers: 
	- Fully connected layers are the final layers in a CNN and are used to classify images. They take the output of the previous layers and use it to make a prediction about the image. 
	- Understanding the role of fully connected layers is important for building and training a CNN.

- Training a CNN: 
	- Training a CNN involves adjusting the weights and biases of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the true output. 
	- The process of training a CNN includes different hyperparameters such as the learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs, it's important to understand how to adjust these hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model.

- Transfer learning in CNNs: 
	- Transfer learning is the process of using a pre-trained model as a starting point to train a new model for a different task. This can save a significant amount of time and computational resources. 
	- Learn about the use of pre-trained models in CNNs and how to fine-tune them for different tasks.
