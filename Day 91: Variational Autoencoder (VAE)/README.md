# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning

## Day 91: Understanding Generative models: Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

**Learning Agenda of Day 91 is :**

- Understanding Generative models: 
	- Learn about the different types of generative models and their applications, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE)

- VAE architecture: 
	- Learn about the architecture of VAEs and how they are used to generate new data.

- Training VAEs: 
	- Learn about the process of training VAEs, including the different hyperparameters that can be adjusted and how to choose appropriate values for them.

- Applications of VAEs: 
	- Learn about the different tasks that VAEs can be used for such as image synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation.

- Practice building and training VAEs for image generation tasks using popular datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
