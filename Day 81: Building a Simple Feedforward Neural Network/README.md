# 100-Days-of-Machine-Learning

## Day 81: Building a Simple Feedforward Neural Network

**Learning Agenda of Day 81 is :**
- Supervised learning and the concept of labeled data
- Understanding datasets and data preprocessing techniques
	- Number of examples, features, and any missing values or outliers. 
	- Normalization, Feature scaling, and Handling missing values
- Building a simple feedforward neural network using a popular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch
	- Understanding the basic components of a neural network such as layers, weights, biases, and activation functions. 
	- The process of creating and defining the architecture of the model, loading and preparing the data and training the model using popular libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
